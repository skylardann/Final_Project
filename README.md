In our project we did a Bike Security system connected over cellular Network. The device notifies you when your bicycle has been stolen or tampered with.  A built in accelerometer reads for changes in the acceleration thresholds and triggers a notification that will be sent to your phone. The system includes a GPS module, so when someone tries to steal your bike, you will know when it is being taken, and where is it going. Create a device that will notify you when someone is trying to steal your bike, based off changes in acceleration. When Bikeguard detects movement it will Text you notifying you that that there has been unusual activity. The device gathers readings from the accelerometer, and by linking it to IFTTT it sends back a notification to the user. The text contains an alert, and a link to google maps.
