Music Visualization Device 
Final Project P&E
Team: Skylar, Juan  

**Summary**
        The music visualization device is a three dimensional sculpture that captures the energy and the flow of music, by reading different sound frequencies and translating sound waves into voltage, which output into color and movement represented through LED lights reflected in a three dimensional space. The sound reader is able to capture any type of sound, making possible a powerful tool to visualize sound. Essentially our project is a audio visualizer that will be represented in a three dimensional space by translating amplitude into colors and movements. 

Different sounds will represent different ranges of amplitudes and thus, different outputs in color and motion, making the intangible representation of sound a tangible visualization. 

**Component Parts**

**Hardware **
SparkFun Sound Detector 
SparkFun RedBoard - Programmed with Arduino
Leds (not decided specifically, how many) 
Momentary Pushbutton Switch 
Trimpot 10K with Knob
Jumper Wires Standard
Breadboard or Solder-able board not sure what would be best)
Electrolytic Decoupling Capacitors - 1000uF/25V
Resistor 330 Ohm 1/6th Watt PTH

**Code**
Code that will translate sound(amp) readings from the sensor into analog readings 
Code that will translate sound(amp) readings from the sensor into digital write  
Code that powers and animates the led lights based the readings of the sound detector.

The code the sound detector produces is an analog representation of the songs amplitude, so we will use these readings as variables to create different patterns that includes both color, movement and brightness.

**Challenges**
It will be challenging to accurately represent the songs visually in a way the makes sense to the common men,  we will research music physcology and color associations that are per establish
It will be difficult create visual coherence throughout the leds in 3 dimensions
It will be difficult to code the animations of the lights based of the sound directors readings 

**Timeline**
Week 1: Write proposal, get approval, order the parts.
Week 2: Write code, and construct sculpture 
Week 3: Integrate all the components together and debug.
Week 4: Complete project, & present.
